# Data-Challenge-1

Thoracic disorders are conditions of the heart, lungs, mediastinum, esophagus, chest wall, diaphragm, and great vessels consisting over 25 different diseases. Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging techniques to diagnose Thoracic disorders. However, the interpretation of chest X-rays can be challenging and requires expert-knowledge.

Wang et al. [1] introduce a data-set of labeled x-rays which is presented as a benchmark for machine learning techniques. They show that pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks can learn to classify a specific Thoracic disorder. During this project, you are tasked to build, train, and evaluate such a neural network that can be used to classify which of the thoracic disorders are present (if at all) in each X-ray image. 

This challenge is based on https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/dataLinks to an external site. but we will use only a subset of the data which was part of that competition (see the description below).
